## Rules

- Never mention AI tools (Cursor, Copilot, Claude, Codex, ChatGPT, etc.) in commit messages or pull request descriptions.
- Commit messages should describe what changed and why — written as if a human made the change.
- PR descriptions should focus on the feature or fix, not how it was built.
